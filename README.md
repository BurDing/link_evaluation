# link_evaluation	
To calculate the relevance between a web link and a given topic.

get_feature(links, topic, relevant_urls)
To parse the web link and the text that owns the hyperlink to 10 numerical features, which are the edit distance and 2,3,4,5,6,7-gram appearance rate of web link and given relevant links, tf value, word similarity and word synonym of the text that owns the hyperlink and topic. 

parameters: 	links: dictionary
			The key is the web link.
			The value is the text that owns the hyperlink.
		topic: string
			The given topic.
		relevant_urls: list of tuples
			The first element of tuple is the web link.
The second element of tuple is the relevance score between this web link and the given topic
return:		output: dictionary
			The key is the web link.
			The value are the numerical features.

generate_train_test(links, topic, relevant_urls, labels)
To separate the original data to train and test.

parameters: 	links: dictionary
			The key is the web link.
			The value is the text that owns the hyperlink.
		topic: string
			The given topic.
		relevant_urls: list of tuples
			The first element of tuple is the web link.
The second element of tuple is the relevance score between this web link and the given topic
		Labels: list
Label the web link with 4 categories, 0, 1, 2, 3, which number is proportional to the relevance.
return:		output: None
			Generate the train set and test set for both features and labels.

train(epochs = 1000, learning_rate = 1e-3)
To train the weight of features using a neural network with three fully connected layers.

parameters: 	epochs: number, optional
			The number is the epochs for training
		learning_rate: number, optional
			The number is learning rate for training
return:		output: None
			Generate a neural network model for web link evaluation.

test()
To test the neural network model.

parameters: 	None
return:		output: None
Test the trained neural network model for web link evaluation and print the test accuracy

get_link_score(links, topic, relevant_urls)
To get the relevance score of web links.

parameters: 	links: dictionary
			The key is the web link.
			The value is the text that owns the hyperlink.
		topic: string
			The given topic.
		relevant_urls: list of tuples
			The first element of tuple is the web link.
The second element of tuple is the relevance score between this web link and the given topic
return:		output: dictionary
			The key is the web link.
			The value is the relevance score, (0, 0.333, 0.666, 1)

Example:

>>> eva = link_evaluation()
>>> eva.generate_train_test(links, topic, relevant_urls, label)

>>> eva.train()
Epoch: 50 129 Loss: 135.996930539608
Epoch: 100 129 Loss: 131.46723574399948
Epoch: 150 129 Loss: 126.40633052587509
â€¦

>>> eva.test()
The test accuracy is: 0.7878787878787878

>>> eva.get_link_score({"www.hbo.com": "series"}, "news", [("www.cnn.com", 1)])
{'www.hbo.com': 0.3333333333333333}

>>> eva.get_link_score({"www.nytimes.com": "new"}, "news", [("www.cnn.com", 1)])
{'www.nytimes.com': 1.0}
